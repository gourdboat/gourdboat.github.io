about the project
- where to find the thing
- music!
- the making of// behind the scenes quality content

- \* for now I'm going to make it all be one page since there isn't enough content to need categories

__the perilous voyage of the little gourd boat__

- at the moment we've got: 
	- story notes & plot brainstormings
	- music sketches
	- character sketches
	- view the repo of everything on github
	- working on getting together some animation test things

then below this on the page is like blog posts
